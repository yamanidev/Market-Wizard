# About
Market Wizard is a generic inventory and point of sale system that I developed alongside my teammates for a school project.

## What I learned from the experience:
- GUI development with JavaFX
- Implementing the MVC architecture, which may be a lousy one, but it was a good start nevertheless
- Integrating SQLite, the modeling and management of a relational database
